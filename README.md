# go-gocron

This repository is a beginner's guide to using `gocron` in Go language. `gocron` is a powerful cron library for Go that allows you to schedule and run periodic tasks.

## Installation

To use `gocron`, you need to have Go installed on your system. If you haven't installed Go, you can download it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/

Once Go is installed, you can install `gocron` by running the following command:

```shell
go get github.com/go-co-op/gocron
```

Getting Started

To start using gocron, you need to import the gocron package in your Go program:
```shell
import "github.com/go-co-op/gocron"
```

Scheduling Tasks

gocron provides an easy way to schedule tasks using a fluent API. Here's an example of how to schedule a task to run every day at 9:00 AM:

```shell
s := gocron.NewScheduler()
s.Every(1).Day().At("09:00").Do(task)
```

You can schedule tasks to run at different intervals such as every hour, every minute, or even at specific times using the available methods provided by gocron.
Defining Tasks

To define a task that should be executed at the scheduled time, you need to create a function that performs the desired actions. Here's an example of a task function:

```shell
func task() {
    // Code to be executed at the scheduled time
}
```

You can perform any actions within the task function, such as sending emails, generating reports, or updating data.
Starting the Scheduler

After defining your tasks and scheduling them, you need to start the scheduler to begin executing the tasks. Here's how you can start the scheduler:

```shell
s.Start()
```

The scheduler will run in the background and execute the scheduled tasks according to the defined schedule.
